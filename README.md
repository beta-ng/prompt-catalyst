# 🚀 Prompt Catalyst 🧠

A curated collection of advanced system prompts designed to unlock the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by instilling them with structured reasoning, domain expertise, and a commitment to transparent, reliable output.

## ✨ Core Philosophy: The Cognitive Workflow

At the heart of every prompt in this collection is the **Cognitive Workflow Protocol**. Think of it as a mandatory "operating system" for the AI that enforces a clear, structured reasoning process.

> **🧠 Think Before You Speak:** Before every response, the agent must perform an internal analysis and present its thought process. This includes:
>
> 1.  **Clarifying its Identity** `🎭`
> 2.  **Building a Context Stack** `📚`
> 3.  **Defining its Focus** `🎯`

This architecture ensures every response is well-structured, context-aware, and transparent, elevating the AI from a simple instruction-follower to a genuine problem-solving partner.

## 🏛️ Key Architectural Pillars

- **🎭 Persona-Based Expertise**: Prompts define specific, expert personas (e.g., a team of software developers or a bioinformatics scientist).
- **🛠️ Mental Model Libraries**: Each agent is equipped with reasoning tools (e.g., First-Principles Thinking, Inversion) to dissect complex problems.
- **🔍 Transparency & Reliability**: By exposing the workflow, you can trust _how_ the AI arrived at an answer, not just the answer itself.
- **📋 Strict Output Formatting**: All agents are bound by rules for professional, clean, and predictable output.
